Telegram-first WordPress operations for linked site teams who want structured site actions, moderation, and notifications from chat.

== Description ==

WP Telepilot lets approved WordPress users link a Telegram account to a WordPress account and then perform short, structured operational tasks from Telegram without trying to replace all of wp-admin.

Features in the current beta include:

* secure Telegram-to-WordPress account linking with short-lived one-time codes
* webhook mode with polling fallback
* role-aware Telegram menus based on the linked WordPress user's capabilities
* site overview, notifications, comments, posts, pages, users, plugins, categories, and tags command groups
* search, pagination, confirmation flows, and audit logging
* secure browser handoff for long-form post editing
* transport diagnostics, queue processing, and webhook/polling health controls
* personal-data export and erasure hooks for linked Telegram account data

WP Telepilot is still in beta during the 0.3.0 cycle. The goal of this release line is to harden packaging, privacy, and operator workflows ahead of the planned 0.3.0 stable release.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` or install it through the WordPress admin.
2. Activate WP Telepilot.
3. Create a Telegram bot with BotFather.
4. Open `WordPress Admin -> WP Telepilot` and paste in the bot token.
5. Choose webhook mode or polling fallback.
6. Save settings.
7. Generate a one-time link code from a user's WordPress profile.
8. In Telegram, send `/link CODE` to the bot from a private chat.
9. Use `/menu` or `/help` to begin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin require Telegram? =

Yes. WP Telepilot is built around the Telegram Bot API and requires a Telegram bot token before the messaging features can work.

= Does it support both webhooks and polling? =

Yes. Webhook mode is the default. Polling fallback is available for hosts or reverse proxies that interfere with Telegram webhook delivery.

= Can it edit long post content directly in chat? =

Long-form post content is handled through a secure browser editing bridge in this beta. Telegram remains the place for shorter actions, decisions, and operational workflows.

= Can it upload media directly from Telegram? =

No. Media is read-only in the current beta release. You can list, search, inspect, and open media items from Telegram, but uploads and destructive media changes remain in wp-admin for now.

= Does it include privacy tooling? =

Yes. WP Telepilot registers privacy-policy helper text plus personal-data exporter and eraser callbacks for linked Telegram metadata and matching audit-log payloads.

== External services ==

This plugin connects to Telegram's Bot API to receive updates and send bot responses.

It sends data to Telegram only after a site administrator configures a bot token.

When enabled, the plugin may send:

* the configured bot token as part of authenticated Bot API requests from your site to Telegram
* Telegram chat identifiers and Telegram user identifiers needed to route responses
* bot response payloads generated from WordPress data that an authorized linked user explicitly requested
* webhook registration data when webhook mode is enabled
